# Design Patterns

## Creational

Creational design patterns are patterns that help us to develop mechanism to create object and classes with flexibility and usability. Examples of some of these patterns are: Abstract Factory, Builder, Multiton, Singleton, among others.

Here we have one example:

- Singleton

This pattern ensures a class has only one instance and can be accessed from anywhere in the code

## Behavioral

Behavioral patterns help us to create comunication mechanisms between objects, paterns like: Command, Interpreter, Observer, among others.

Here we have one example:

- Observer

With this pattern we can subscribe to an specify subject and the subject will notify all of the observers the changes that has occurred.

## Structural

Structural patterns are responsible to assemble objects and mage large strcutures in a efficient and flexbile way, patterns like: Composite, Facade, adapter, bridge, among others.

Here we have one example:

- Composite

This is a pattern that help us to compose objects into a tree structure using recursive composition.
